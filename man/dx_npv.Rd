\title{Calculate Negative Predictive Value (NPV)}
\usage{
dx_npv(cm, detail = "full", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cm}{A dx_cm object created by \code{\link[=dx_cm]{dx_cm()}}.}

\item{detail}{Character specifying the level of detail in the output:
"simple" for raw estimate, "full" for detailed estimate
including 95\% confidence intervals.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to metric_binomial function, such as
\code{citype} for type of confidence interval method.}
}
\value{
Depending on the \code{detail} parameter, returns a numeric value
representing the calculated metric or a data frame/tibble with
detailed diagnostics including confidence intervals and possibly other
metrics relevant to understanding the metric.
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of true negatives out of the total predicted negatives
(true negatives + false negatives), known as the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).
This metric is a measure of the classifier's ability to identify negatives correctly.
Note that NPV, like other metrics, may not fully represent classifier performance
in unbalanced datasets and should be used alongside other metrics.
}
\details{
NPV is the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true and false negatives. It is an
indicator of how well the classifier can identify negative instances. High NPV means
that the classifier is reliable in its negative classifications. However, it may be
influenced by the prevalence of the condition and is best used in conjunction with
other metrics like PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for a comprehensive evaluation.

The formula for NPV is:
\deqn{NPV = \frac{True Negatives}{True Negatives + False Negatives}}{NPV = TN / (TN + FN)}

cm <- dx_cm(dx_heart_failure$predicted, dx_heart_failure$truth,

    0.5, poslabel = 1

detailed_npv <- dx_npv(cm)
